We/PRON first/ADV show/VERB that/ADP the/DET function/NOUN is/VERB single-valued/ADJ in/ADP some/DET neighborhood/NOUN ./. 
With/ADP the/DET vertex/NOUN at/ADP Af/NOUN in/ADP the/DET C-plane/NOUN we/PRON assume/VERB that/ADP Af/NOUN is/VERB the/DET parametric/ADJ location/NOUN on/ADP C/NOUN of/ADP an/DET ordinary/ADJ intersection/NOUN Q/NOUN between/ADP C/NOUN and/CONJ Af/NOUN ./. 
In/ADP the/DET f-plane/NOUN the/DET coordinates/NOUN of/ADP the/DET corresponding/ADJ point/NOUN are/VERB Af/NOUN ./.

In/ADP the/DET neighborhood/NOUN of/ADP an/DET end/NOUN point/NOUN of/ADP an/DET interval/NOUN of/ADP tangent/ADJ points/NOUN in/ADP the/DET f-plane/NOUN the/DET function/NOUN is/VERB two-valued/ADJ or/CONJ no-valued/ADJ on/ADP one/NUM side/NOUN ,/. and/CONJ is/VERB a/DET single-valued/ADJ function/NOUN consisting/VERB entirely/ADV of/ADP tangent/ADJ points/NOUN on/ADP the/DET other/ADJ side/NOUN ./.
